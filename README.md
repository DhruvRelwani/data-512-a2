## Bias in Data

The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries. For this assignment, you will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article.

## Data

The [Wikipedia politicians by country dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_Item/5513449) can be found on Figshare. The population data is available in CSV format as WPDS_2020_data.csv. This dataset is drawn from the [world population data sheet](https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table/) published by the Population Reference Bureau.
